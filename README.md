# Recording Setup

## Objective

This document outlines the steps and resources you can use to record talks using the Dev Edmonton Society recording gear. Talks recorded with this setup are suitable for upload to a video archive like YouTube, or can be live streamed where bandwidth and connection allows.

## Pre-requisites

### Hardware

#### [Epihan AV.io HD video grabber](https://www.epiphan.com/products/avio-hd/)

My favourite piece of kit in our little setup, this captures virtually any HDMI video and outputs over USB as a generic webcam video source in 1080p at 60 frames per second. There are no drivers needed on Windows, Mac, or Linux and it delivers a continuous video stream even when HDMI is connected and disconnected multiple times over the course of a night.

I have had issues with it outputting odd video sizes when outputting from presenters laptops, so I recommend downloading [the configuration tool from the resources on their website](https://www.epiphan.com/products/avio-hd/resources/). You can use this to check out native resolution coming into and out of the AV.io which can be useful if you have any issues with OBS (more on that later.)

#### USB Audio Capture

We’ve got a simple USB audio capture box which takes two XLR inputs (the large microphone connections) and exposes them as a USB audio source. No drivers are required and it just appears as another microphone in your audio settings.

#### [Saramonic Wireless Lavalier Microphone System](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01IMJDW9Q/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

This wireless microphone comes in a paired transmitter / receiver. They each take 2 AA batteries, so please make sure you check battery levels and replace them before each recording.

#### [Logitech BRIO](https://www.logitech.com/en-ca/product/brio)

We’ve recently upgraded our webcam to a new 4K HDR model. Given we’re often recording speakers in poor lighting conditions, the extra pixels and adjustable HDR has greatly improved the quality of the speaker videa. You’ll want to make sure that you also [download the camera settings software](https://support.logitech.com/en_ca/product/brio/downloads) to configure the camera as you can use it to zoom in and follow the speaker as they talk.

#### USB Hub

With all the accesories, you'll want a USB hub to connect it together. I usually plug the HD video grabber directly into my laptop, then run everything else through the hub.

#### HDMI Splitter

We use an HDMI splitter so that we can have two copies of the presenters laptop video. One goes up to the projector, and the second runs into the recording laptop.

#### HDMI Cables

You'll need an HDMI cable from the presenter to the splitter, then again from the recording laptop to the 

#### Projector
